Just wanted to say hi for the holiday, saw your post about the "original" Thanksgiving meals -- actually all that sounds better than the modern menus!  I had venison once or twice, it was delicious but a little sad to think about some poor young deer being killed.  2023 seems to have flew by --- I'm sort of mad at myself about Thanksgiving a year ago, when I was supposed to go over to Brooklyn, then things got hectic and there was that storm --- but then I missed the chance to touch base one more stime since not long after you transferred to LA.  I'm still sorry about all that!  Looks like you're still in Gainesville, hope you're enjoying it there!  Re Susan Sarandon, no way she should have been dropped by her agency for her pretty middle-of-the-road comments.  After all this I don't ever want to hear conservatives complaining about left-wing "cancel culture"!

Happy new year!  Just watched the ball drop via the web.  I hope you feel very healthy and energized throughout 2024.  Interesting video from the end of 2023, trippy parade -- was that a fish motorcycle?  Maybe Gainesville's got more going on that I thought!  Anyways enjoy the Florida winter ...  Best wishes for the new year!

I'd like to see the poll's breakdown by age.  I suspect a good percentage -- maybe over 50% -- of young people (under 30, say) whose parent are Jewish agree with more progressive positions vis-a-vis Israel, or protests.  They may not endorse extremist groups aligned with JVP, but I suspect most JVP activists don't either, just as most MAGA activists aren't neo-Nazis.
